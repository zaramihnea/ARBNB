  <section id="intro">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    <strong>ARBNB</strong> is a conceptual design for a property rental platform, modeled after the core ideas behind Airbnb. This documentation outlines the interaction patterns, design principles, and user experience decisions as implemented in a high-fidelity Figma prototype. The prototype serves as a foundation for future development and user testing.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section id="patterns">
    <h2>2. Interaction Design Patterns</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Search & Filter</h3>
    <p>
        Users engage with a dynamic search bar that supports keyword inputs and autocomplete suggestions. This model follows the <strong>Search and Refine</strong> pattern and is rooted in the heuristic of <em>visibility of system status</em>.  This pattern enhances discoverability and ensures users can locate relevant items quickly by narrowing down options.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> On the home screen of the mobile app, users begin typing a city name such as “Cluj-Napoca” into the search bar. 
        Instantly, the interface displays location suggestions beneath the input field, including matching neighborhoods and popular tourist districts. 
        The property list updates dynamically with each filter adjustment, ensuring that only the most relevant options are shown.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Progressive Disclosure</h3>

    <p>
        Only the most essential information is shown initially, while additional details are hidden and can be revealed on user action (e.g., click, tap). 
        This reduces cognitive load and avoids overwhelming users. This supports the principle of <em>cognitive economy</em> and aligns with the <strong>progressive disclosure</strong> pattern.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Property listings show a short description, and clicking expands to reveal the full details, like 
        host information(name, hosting history) description of the property, number of guests, bedrooms, amenities, house rules,
        price, address or general area with a map preview.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Infinite Scroll / Load More</h3>
    <p>
        As users scroll down a list, additional content is automatically loaded, creating a seamless and uninterrupted browsing experience, improving navigation flow and reducing the need for pagination or extra clicks.
        Alternatively, a “Load More” button can be used to load the next batch of results.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> The Property Listing page showcases all available accommodations based on the user’s input, giving a broad overview of relevant options in a visually engaging, scrollable format.
        Each property is displayed as a card featuring a thumbnail image, title, rating, and information abot the host. 
        This layout allows users to quickly scan through listings without needing to open each one individually. 
        As users scroll down the screen, the interface dynamically loads additional entries using infinite scroll, ensuring a seamless browsing experience without the need for manual pagination. 
        This approach enhances user engagement by minimizing friction, keeping attention focused on discovering new properties without interruption.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Tabbed Navigation</h3>

    <p>
        Information is organized into distinct tabs that users can quickly switch between without leaving the current page. This helps in segmenting content logically.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> On a property page, tabs like “Reviews”, "Details", “Map”, and “Tour” let users access different content views easily. This tabbed navigation structure helps prevent information overload by organizing content into distinct, easily accessible sections. For instance, users can quickly switch to the “Reviews” tab to read guest feedback without losing their place, or jump to the “Map” tab to view the property's location and nearby attractions. The interface updates smoothly without reloading the page, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience while maintaining context.
    </p>

    <h3>2.5 Breadcrumb Navigation</h3>

    <p>
        Breadcrumbs display the user’s navigation path in a hierarchical format, allowing them to easily backtrack through previous levels or sections of the app. This pattern is particularly effective in mobile interfaces with nested or categorized content, where users may dive deep into a specific item or category. Breadcrumbs enhance usability by reinforcing the user’s current position within the app structure and providing a clear route to return to broader overviews without needing to use the back button multiple times.
    </p>

    <p>
       <strong>Example:</strong> A navigation trail such as <em>Home > Cabins > Rustic Cabin in Cluj-Napoca, Romania > Reviews</em> allows the user to tap on “Cabins” to return to the general category or on “Cluj-Napoca” to view all cabins available in that specific region. This supports quick backward navigation and helps users efficiently move through different content layers.
    </p>

<section id="decisions">
  <h2>3. Design Decisions</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Visual Minimalism</h3>
  <p>
    For this prototype, a modern and minimalistic UI style was chosen to create a clean and intuitive user experience. The design emphasizes clear typography, generous whitespace, and a calm, neutral color palette. These choices aim to prioritize the display of essential content while minimizing visual clutter, which helps reduce user cognitive load and decision fatigue. Since this is a Figma prototype, the focus was on establishing a clear visual hierarchy and an aesthetic foundation that can be iterated on during development.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Role-based Navigation</h3>
  <p>
    The navigation structure in the prototype adapts dynamically based on the user’s role — whether they are a host or a guest. Hosts have access to features like property listing management and analytics dashboards, while guests see personalized recommendations and trip planning tools. Although this behavior is conceptual within the prototype, it reflects an important design decision aimed at tailoring the experience to different user needs and simplifying interface complexity by showing only relevant features.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Trust Signals</h3>
  <p>
    Building user trust is vital for a platform facilitating bookings and payments. The prototype integrates visual trust elements such as user reviews. These signals are prominently displayed to increase user confidence and reduce hesitation during the booking process. While the prototype does not implement backend verification, these design elements serve as a blueprint for how trust and security can be visually communicated.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4 Performance Considerations</h3>
  <p>
    Although performance cannot be fully tested in a static Figma prototype, design decisions anticipate smooth and responsive user interactions. The prototype incorporates concepts like lazy loading placeholders for images, modular component layouts, and streamlined data presentation. These concepts guide future development toward efficient rendering and data fetching strategies, ensuring the final app remains performant even on constrained mobile networks.
